ArtGuard: Invisible Watermarking for Digital Artists  

Protect your art, defend your rights.
ArtGuard is a free, open-source tool designed to help artists safeguard their digital creations with invisible watermarks. These watermarks don’t affect the appearance of your artwork but serve as undeniable proof of ownership.  

🌟 Why ArtGuard?
Art theft is a persistent issue in the digital age, with stolen work often reposted, cropped, or claimed by others. GhostMark gives artists the power to fight back by embedding hidden watermarks that can’t be removed or tampered with.  

With GhostMark, you can:  
- Embed Invisible Watermarks: Protect your art without compromising its beauty.  
- Authenticate Ownership: Prove your rights with embedded metadata like your name and timestamp.  
- Join a Community of Artists: Optional public logging for peer verification and support.  

 🚀 Features 
- Invisible Watermarking: Embed undetectable data (e.g., your name, timestamp) into your images.  
- Proof of Ownership: Extract watermarks later to authenticate stolen or reposted works.  
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works with popular formats like PNG and JPG.  
- Open Source: Built by artists, for artists—free to use, modify, and improve.  
- Community Support: Share your work in an optional public repository for collaborative protection.

2. Decode the Watermark

   - Extract and verify the embedded metadata to prove ownership.
